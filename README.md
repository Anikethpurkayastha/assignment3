This repository contains two basic Python programs demonstrating fundamental concepts such as loops, functions, and the use of Python’s built-in math module. The first script is a factorial calculator. It prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates its factorial using a simple for loop. The logic multiplies each integer from 2 up to the input number to compute the result. The final output displays the factorial of the number entered by the user.

The second script performs three mathematical operations on a user-provided number: calculating the square root, the natural logarithm (log base e), and the sine value (in radians). It makes use of Python’s math module, which provides access to these functions. The program takes a floating-point number as input, computes the required values, and prints the results clearly to the user.
